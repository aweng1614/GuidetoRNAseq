# at Northwestern, we use Quest b/c it has the computational power we need for RNAseq analysis 

# 1. apply for a Quest allocation 
# 2. connect to Quest using Terminal - you can do this by searching "terminal" in the finder on both Mac/Windows 
# 2a. for Windows, you need to download either FastX or PuTTY (I have FastX) to connect to Quest 

  3. connect to Quest using the command: ssh (secure shell) 
  4. In Terminal, type: ssh aws531@quest.northwestern.edu or netid@northwestern.edu 
  5. enter netID password 
  6. enter the directory (like a term for workspace/folder) for your lab's allocation 
    - for example: cd /projects/e31265 but instead of e31265, you'll put your lab's allocation 
  7. you will make a directory for yourself - I like to do this by making a directory with my netid 
    - mkdir (make directory) aws531 (or whatever you want to call it) 
  8. enter the directory by typing: cd /projects/allocation/netid 

  9. For anything you want to transfer from your own personal computer, use scp 
  10. I like to open a separate terminal window for this
    - for example (transfer to personal computer): scp aws531@quest.northwestern.edu: /projects/allocation/netid/subdirectory/filename Path/to/your/Local/file
    - for example (transfer to Quest): scp Path/to/Local/File aws531@quest.northwestern.edu: /projects/allocation/netid/subdirectory/filename

  Other shortcuts: 
- cd: change directory 
- pwd: find current directory 
- cd .. :go to parent directory (one above it) 
- mkdir: make directory 
- rmdir: remove directory 
- rm: remove 
- rm *.bam: remove all .bam files or any other type of files (just substitute .bam)
